    <h1>Hello, I'm Flickaru</h1>
    <h3>Intemediate web developer (HTML + CSS)</h3>
    <p>I am an intermediate website developer making projects based on HTML and CSS, like this website. I'm interested in technology
        and coding which is why I like to make fun coding projects and I also learn from them which helps me
        in making stuff for the future.
    </p>
    <p>My projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/flickaru">GitHub</a>. <br>
        Most of my repositories contain things you can put on your website and modify, for example a login form.
    Here are some of my repositories:</p>
    <div class="github-widget" data-user="flickaru"></div>
    <p>I also have a website called <a href="https://flickaru.store">flickaru.store</a> which I don't really use or maintain.</p>
